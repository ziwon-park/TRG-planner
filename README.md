## 🙏 Acknowledgements

We would like to express our gratitude to team [DreamSTEP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7HlqAP4l0c) for their invaluable help in developing this project for the IEEE QRC competition. It was completed and tested with their support. We are also grateful to the authors of the open-sourced [kdtree](https://github.com/jtsiomb/kdtree), which was modified as the data structure for this project. Additionally, we would like to thank [Zhang Lab](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/robotics-groups/zhang-lab/) for providing an [excellent environment](https://github.com/HongbiaoZ/autonomous_exploration_development_environment), some of which we utilized during the development of this project. A special thanks goes to my respected research mentor, [Hyungtae Lim](https://limhyungtae.github.io/aboutme/), for his invaluable guidance and for inspiring the open-sourcing style of this project. His latest work, [KISS-Matcher](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/KISS-Matcher), emphasizing modern C++ and CMake practices, has been a great reference and influence on our source-available pipeline.

Their contributions to the community have greatly enhanced our project, and we genuinely appreciate their support. We hope this project will also make a meaningful contribution to the community.
